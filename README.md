# Automated-Hydroponic-Farming-System
This project has been done to control the environmental parameters that are suitable for Hydroponic Farming. DHT11 sensor is used to measure the temperature and humidity. According to the measured values, a fan controls the temperature and used a solenoid valve controls the humidity. Fan and valve execute when parameters reach a specific value.
